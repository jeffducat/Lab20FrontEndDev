    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
            A more recent interest of mine has been travel. Just a couple of months ago my wife and I visited Cartagena, Columbia. This
            was our 20th country visited together in the past 5 years. We are budget travelers and have taught ourselves how to
            use airline miles to assist us with our travels. Travels that have included visits ranging to a large majority of
            western European countries to Morocco and Thailand and Cambodia. After this trip we will have visited 5 of the 7
            continents with only Australia and Antarctica to go. The possibility of becoming location independent within the next
            decade by being a freelance coder is one of the biggest draws of coding for me.

            The number one reason I am choosing software development is because I think that it is something that I enjoy doing. The
            concept of creating my own websites excites me. I want to move on to a career that is more than just a paycheck. I also
            want to learn a marketable skill. After spending the better part of the past two decades on different career paths. A
            path ranging from shipping, manufacturing, sales and retail management, I need a change. I want to start with an in
            demand, skill that will shape my future in the best way possible. I believe that becoming a developer is the best choice
            to have a relevant career for the rest of my employment life.
